        COEP’s Annual National-Level Sports Festival, called ZEST.<br>
        ZEST is the sports extravaganza that everyone prepares for, that everyone waits for, and that everyone aims
        for. ZEST is the platform for all the amateur sportspeople, and is also a battlefield for all the experienced
        veterans, having tons of experience and skill in their game. For the past 16 years, ZEST has always been on
        the rise, witnessing stellar action and competition from participants across all over the country. On top of
        that, students of COEP also participate in ZEST and win laurels for their college. To put it short, ZEST is
        THE place to be, and the sporting avenue to explore!

        MindSpark is the national level annual technical festival hosted by the college and established in 2007. The
        idea behind MindSpark originated from the need to unite various departmental level festivals that were scattered
        across the academic calendar. It features about 50 events across various disciplines of engineering and has been
        backed by the support of industrial sponsors who also associate with COEP for placement. This event is usually
        scheduled in an odd semester (around September) and is of 3 days (usually weekend).[24][25]

        The College of Engineering, Pune is among the few colleges in the world which hosts an annual regatta. Since its
        inception in 1928, it has showcased around 165 boats, notably the Eighter, which is one of the oldest boats.[26]
        The 91st edition of Regatta was held on 10 March 2019. Unlike a Regatta which means a collection of boat races,
        COEP Boat Club's Regatta is a show of various kinds of boats, kayaks, punts, shell boats and scull boats. The
        events in this show are Telematches, Kayak Ballet, Shell Games, Punt Formation, Mashaal Dance and the Arrow
        formation.

        December and lasts for 3 days. Impressions was formed as a platform "for the artists, by the artists", to
        provide opportunities for people from the fields of dance, music, theatre, art, and fashion to display their
        talent. The events span over six main modules, namely – Dance, Music, Arts and Crafts, Dramatics, Photography,
        and Writing.
